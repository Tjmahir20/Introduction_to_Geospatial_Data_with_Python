# Introduction to Geospatial Data with Python

This repository consists of scripts and lecture materials from a [workshop](https://itc-crib.github.io/2024-02-14-Geospatial-Python-Workshop/) organized by [CRIB](https://www.itc.nl/about-itc/centres-of-expertise/big-geodata/).

The workshop mostly covered these aspects of geospatial data processing:
- Basics of raster and vector data and coordinate reference systems (CRSs)
- Access satellite imagery using Python
- Read, visualize and process raster/vector data
- Data analysis with the combination of raster and vector data
- Parallel computation for geospatial data

## Overview
All the required data and preprocessing steps can be found in this [website](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/index.html).

The workshop had three segments:

(i) Accessing Raster Data

(ii) Analysis of Raster and Vector Data

(iii) Computing Big Data with Dask
